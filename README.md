# Crown-of-the-Town
ICS201 ISU
Grade 10 ISU project

Inspired by the game "Sort the Court" by graebor.
All art done by my brother, programmed by me.
Still many bugs because this was made in 2 weeks.

All files must be downloaded and placed in the same folder as the .t file for it to run properly.
Text files must be installed for them to be applied to the game.
