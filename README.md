# Crown of the Town
ICS201 ISU January 2018<br>
Grade 10 ISU project

Inspired by the game "Sort the Court" by graebor.<br>
All art (sprites, backgrounds, title & end screens) done by my brother, dialogue written and game programmed by me.

All files must be downloaded and placed in the same folder as the .t file for it to run properly.<br>
Text files must be installed for them to be applied to the game.
